# Testing Suite For MAD9124 w2024 Assignment 2

## Running the tests

- Copy `.env.example` into an `.env` file in the same directory.
- Ensure your API is running on the matching port, and is using the same `MONGO_URL` as the tests. (Feel free to change the name in the tests, just know all collections will be deleted at the end of the tests)
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run test`. View the output of the tests.

### NOTE

I will be looking at more than these tests when grading.
